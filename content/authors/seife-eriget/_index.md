Recently, large-scale urban hydrology modeling, water resources management particulary floods, and the scaling behavior of flood peaks have been my primary research areas.

As part of my everyday life inquiry, I also like to read books on eastern mysticism, especially those that focus on the non-dual path and self-realization. Apart from that, my favorite things to do are play and watch soccer.
