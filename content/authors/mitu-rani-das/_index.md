I have a bachelor’s degree in Water Resources Engineering, and my current work focuses on assessing the vulnerability and resilience of hydropower reservoirs and dams in the context of future reservoir operations and climate conditions. I am also passionate about hydrologic modeling and integrating these models with social dimensions to enhance policy-making in water resources management, aiming for sustainable and resilient solutions.

In my personal life, I enjoy spending time with friends, whether it’s hanging out or traveling to new places. I am passionate about outdoor activities like volunteering, club events and playing sports, especially badminton. In my downtime, I enjoy listening to music and watching anime.
